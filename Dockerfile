#   - nodejs/npm  → provides `npx` for npx-based MCP servers (e.g. memory)
#   - uv          → provides `uvx` for uvx-based MCP servers (e.g. fetch)
#   - git/curl    → commonly needed by MCP servers fetched on demand

#         silently degrading to the keyword fallback
#   pdf → reportlab, so `vulnclaw report --pdf` works in the container
# `traffic` (mitmproxy + playwright) is deliberately excluded: Playwright also
# needs browser binaries pulled in via `playwright install`, which would add
# hundreds of MB. Add it here if you need the live proxy/browser backends.
